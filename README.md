##Related/Contained projects
Currently contains [IGW-mod](https://github.com/MineMaarten/IGW-mod) and [Baubles](https://github.com/Azanor/Baubles) until those get updated to 1.8.8, then it will revert to using them as libraries

Contains a modifed version of [NBTEdit](https://github.com/DavidGoldman/NBTEdit) which is currently used for debugging, will probably be removed eventually as well.

[Tabula Model loading code](https://github.com/Thutmose/Pokecube/tree/master/Pokecube%20Core/src/main/java/pokecube/modelloader/client/tabula) is a modified version of the one used for [Showcase](https://github.com/iLexiconn/Showcase), If the one in there, or [LLibrary](https://github.com/iLexiconn/LLibrary) gets the same functionailty, I will probably remove it and use theirs instead, adding them as a dependancy for Pokécube.

Contains JEP by Nathan Funk and Richard Morris for use with spawn logic, lisence [here](https://github.com/Thutmose/Pokecube/blob/master/Pokecube%20Core/src/main/java/org/nfunk/jep/license.txt)
